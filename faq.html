If you like almond butter, cashew butter, or peanut butter, then you'll really like Fit Frost.

<p>Protein quality: legumes, nuts, and seeds have much lower quality protein than the whey protein concentrate in Fit Frost Pro. This may be quantified by a variety of metrics; see table 1 in <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0007114512002309">this report</a>. The most well-known metric is the protein digestibility-corrected amino acid score (PDCAAS). It multiplies the protein's digestibility by how closely its amino acid composition matches a complete `reference' protein. Peanuts score <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_Digestibility_Corrected_Amino_Acid_Score">0.52</a>, almonds score <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16187015">0.23</a>, cashews sc  and almonds score  
<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16187015">0.23</a>.
Fit Frost Pro's whey has a maximal score of 1. A newer method is the <a href="http://www.fao.org/ag/humannutrition/35978-02317b979a686a57aa4593304ffc17f06.pdf">Digestible Indispensable Amino Acid Score (DIAAS)</a>. It more accurately measures 'ileal' digestibility in the intestine rather than in feces. 
In this metric, the gap between whey and peanuts <a href="http://jn.nutrition.org/content/early/2014/11/26/jn.114.195438">is even more pronounced</a>.

<p>Fat quality: in most senses, coconuts are generally believed to have a superior fatty acid composition than . Modern nutrition science does not characterize fats as `good' or `bad'. Nonetheless, in developed countries, most people consume too much Omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids. 

Coconut oil is an excellent source of medium-chain triglycerides. It is the best plant-based source of lauric, caprylic, palmitic, and butyric acid. "MCTs passively diffuse from the GI tract to the portal system (longer fatty acids are absorbed into the lymphatic system) without requirement for modification like long-chain fatty acids or very-long-chain fatty acids. In addition, MCTs do not require bile salts for digestion."  these are not processed by the liver, (seem to) bypass the usual digestive process in lieue of direct utilization by the body. 

<p>Freshness: even with refrigeration, all nut butters slowly become rancid. Fit Frost stays fresh longer because it has relatively high saturated fat and relatively low moisture. There are two ways oil becomes rancid. Oxidative rancidification occurs when... Oxidative rancidity leads to the formation of both unpalatable and toxic compounds. Three distinct classes of substance occuring in oxidised fat have been shown to be toxic:
a) Peroxidised fatty acids  (peroxidised fatty acids destroy both vitamin A and E in foods).
b) Polymeric material (under normal food processing conditions these appear in small enough quantities to be insignificant).
c) Oxidised sterols (thought to be involved in the causation of artherosclerotic disease).
Unsaturated fats are prone to this kind of rancidification; saturated fats are not. That's why Fit Frost has attractive transparent packaging, and doesn't require refrigeration. 
Hydrolytic rancidification affects taste and appearance but not nutrition. It occurs when an enzyme (i.e. lipase) or catalyst decomposes triglycerides into glycerol and free fatty acids.The <a href="http://www.sugar-and-sweetener-guide.com/glycerol.html">former</a> is a sweet-tasting polyol with a glycemic index of 3 (relative to 65 for glucose). The latter are just the fatty acids identified above. Some people think free lauric acid tastes soapy. Fortunately, since Fit Frost has relatively little water, it is not prone to this kind of rancidity, either.
