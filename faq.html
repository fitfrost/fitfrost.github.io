<p>Protein quality: legumes, nuts, and seeds have much lower quality protein than the whey in Fit Frost Pro. This may be quantified by a variety of metrics; see table 1 in <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0007114512002309">this report</a>. The most well-known metric is the protein digestibility-corrected amino acid score (PDCAAS). It multiplies the protein's digestibility by how closely its amino acid composition matches a complete `reference' protein. Peanuts score <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_Digestibility_Corrected_Amino_Acid_Score">0.52</a>, almonds score <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16187015">0.23</a>, cashews sc  and almonds score  
<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16187015">0.23</a>.
Fit Frost Pro's whey has a maximal score of 1. A newer method is the <a href="http://www.fao.org/ag/humannutrition/35978-02317b979a686a57aa4593304ffc17f06.pdf">Digestible Indispensable Amino Acid Score (DIAAS)</a>. It more accurately measures 'ileal' digestibility in the intestine rather than in feces. 
In this metric, the gap between whey and peanuts <a href="http://jn.nutrition.org/content/early/2014/11/26/jn.114.195438">is even more stark</a>.

<p>Fat quality: coconuts are generally believed to have a superior fatty acid composition than . In particular, coconuts are 

More fresh: since Fit Frost insubject to two kinds of rancidification. Oxidative rancidification occurs . 

Unsaturated fats are much more prone to this than the saturated fats . That's why Fit Frost is packaged in attractive, transparent jars. 

Hydrolytic rancidification occurs when . Triglycerides separate into glycerol and free fatty acids. The former is a low-glycemic sugar alcohol. The latter mostly consists of lauric acid.
